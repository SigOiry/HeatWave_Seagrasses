\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Intertidal seagrasses play a crucial role in the ecosystem by providing
habitats and feeding grounds for various marine species, supporting rich
marine biodiversity, and contributing significantly to primary
production and carbon sequestration
\citep{unsworth2022planetary, sousa2019blue}. These seagrasses are
essential in maintaining the health of coastal ecosystems by stabilizing
sediments, filtering water, and serving as indicators of environmental
changes due to their sensitivity to water quality variations
\citep{zoffoli2021decadal}. The interactions between seagrass meadows
and their associated herbivores further enhance the delivery of
ecosystem services, including coastal protection and fisheries support
\citep{jankowska2019stabilizing, zoffoli2023remote, gardner2018global}.
Understanding and preserving these ecosystems are vital for maintaining
the biodiversity and productivity of coastal regions
\citep{scott2018role, ramesh2020seagrass}.

Despite their crucial role in marine ecosystems, intertidal seagrasses
face numerous threats that compromise their health and functionality.
Coastal development and human activities are primary threats. These
activities not only reduce the available habitat for seagrasses but also
increase water turbidity, which limits light penetration and hampers
photosynthesis \citep{waycott2009accelerating}. Seagrasses are also
threatened by nutrient enrichment from agricultural and urban runoff,
which can lead to eutrophication. This condition promotes the overgrowth
of algal blooms that compete with seagrasses for light and nutrients,
further stressing these important plants \citep{thomsen2023meadow} (Oiry
et al.~2024). Pollution from industrial and agricultural fields sources
introduces harmful chemicals and heavy metals into coastal waters,
posing toxic risks to seagrass health. These pollutants can affect the
physiological processes of seagrasses, reducing their growth and
survival rates \citep{sevgi2022bitkilerde} Additionally, invasive
species can out compete native seagrasses for resources, altering
community structure and function \citep{simpson2016distribution}.

Heatwaves, exacerbated by climate change, pose a growing threat to
seagrasses. Marine Heatwaves (MHW), defined by
\citep{hobday2016hierarchical} as prolonged discrete anomalously warm
water events, and Atmospheric Heatwaves (AHW), defined by
\citep{perkins2013measurement} as periods of at least three consecutive
days with temperatures exceeding the 90th percentile, cause severe
physiological stress on seagrasses
\citep{sawall2021chronically, deguette2022physiological}. At the
interface between the land and oceans, intertidal seagrasses are exposed
to both MHW and AHW. Heatwaves have profound impacts on seagrasses, with
their effects varying based on species and geographic location. For
instance, the seagrass \emph{Zostera marina} exhibits high
susceptibility to elevated sea surface temperatures during winter and
spring, leading to advanced flowering, high mortality rates, and reduced
biomass \citep{sawall2021chronically}. Similarly, \emph{Cymodocea
nodosa} shows increased photosynthetic activity during heatwaves but
suffers negative effects on photosynthetic performance and leaf biomass
during recovery \citep{deguette2022physiological}. Additionally,
different populations of \emph{Zostera marina} along the European
thermal gradient exhibit varied photophysiological responses during the
recovery phase of heatwaves, indicating differential adaptation
capabilities among populations \citep{winters2011effects}. These events
intensify other stressors, such as overgrazing and seed burial,
compromising sexual recruitment \citep{guerrero2020heat}.

Bleaching and browning events of seagrass beds have been observed
following episodes of intense heat along the Brittany coast of France
(Pers. obs.) then affecting leaf color, which are expected to alter leaf
reflectance. Remote sensing is increasingly being utilized to monitor
marine ecosystems, including seagrass meadows. By using spectral
indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), or by analyzing specific
spectral patterns, remote sensing can effectively quantify vegetation
health over time
\citep{huete2012vegetation, kloos2021agricultural, carlan2020identifying, akbar2020mangrove}.
Through the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework
Directive, Europe is promoting remote sensing techniques for habitat
mapping, as these methods enable the monitoring of extensive areas over
time \citep{papathanasopoulou2019satellite}. This study will
experimentally test the hypothesis that warm events modify the pigment
composition and reflectance of seagrass, linking these changes with
satellite remote sensing.

\section{Material \& Methods}\label{material-methods}

\subsection{Heatwaves detection and
characterisation}\label{heatwaves-detection-and-characterisation}

\subsubsection{Air temperature}\label{air-temperature}

Since January 1, 2024, Meteo France weather data has been freely and
openly accessible. Hourly air temperature data (°C) for the French coast
of the Atlantic and the Channel has been downloaded using a
\href{https://github.com/SigOiry/HeatWave_Seagrasses/blob/main/MeteoFrance_Extraction.qmd}{custom
script}, as no API has been developed for downloading this data at the
date of this study. Weather stations located within 10 kilometers of the
coastline were considered, but only those with a minimum of 30 years of
data were included to ensure accurate climatology reconstruction. Among
the 156 weather stations comprised within the 10km of coastline, only 36
had enough data to reconstruct the climatology. Hourly data has been
aggregated to daily mean temperatures at each station.

Heatwave detection was performed using the HeatwaveR package in R
\citep{heatwaveR}. This package utilizes the methodology proposed by
\citep{hobday2016hierarchical} to detect heatwave events. The
climatology for the year was computed using the temperature time series.
An event was considered a heatwave each time the temperature exceeded
the 90th percentile of the climatology for five consecutive days. The
severity of each event has been assessed using the methodology proposed
by \citep{hobday2018categorizing}.

\subsection{Experiment}\label{experiment}

\subsubsection{Sampling and Acclimation of
seagrasses}\label{sampling-and-acclimation-of-seagrasses}

Seagrass was sampled from a \emph{Nanozostera noltei} (dwarf eelgrass,
syn. Zostera noltei) meadow on Noirmoutier Island, France (46°57'32.0''N
2°10'37.0''W) at low tide in June 2024. A shovel was used to sample
seagrass from an area of 30 cm by 15 cm and 5 cm deep, maintaining the
sediment structure and avoiding damage to the rhizomes and the leafs of
the seagrass. The seagrass, along with sediment, meiofauna, and
macrofauna, was placed in plastic trays. To avoid hydric stress during
transportation, seawater was added to each tray. Simultaneously,
seawater was sampled from a nearby site and transported to the lab,
where it was filtered using a 0.22 µm nitrocellulose filter to remove
all suspended particulate matter. This seawater was used in the
acclimation tank and the intertidal chambers. The seagrasses were
acclimated at high tide for one weeks with a water temperature of 17°C,
matching the temperature at the time of sampling, and with light of 150
µmol.s-1.m-2 of PAR photons \citep{akbar2020mangrove}. A wave generator
was used in the tank to circulate and reoxygenate the water.

\subsubsection{Experimental design}\label{experimental-design}

Two intertidal chambers from
\href{https://electricblue.eu/intertidal-chamber}{ElectricBlue} were
used to simulate tidal cycles and control water temperature during high
tide and air temperature during low tide. One chamber served as the
control, while the other was used for the experimental treatment. The
control chamber was maintained at temperatures representative of the
typical seasonal conditions: water temperatures between 18°C and 19°C
and air temperatures between 18°C and 23°C, following circadian
temperature variability (Figure~\ref{fig-Profile}). For the experimental
treatment, the air temperature was set to mimic an atmospheric heatwave
that occurred over the seagrass meadow of Porh Saint-Guénël, Plouharnel,
France (47°35'40.0''N, 3°07'30.0''W) from August 26, 2021, to September
6, 2021. On the first day of the experiment, air temperatures in the
experimental chamber were set to range from 23°C at night to 35°C during
the day, with a daily increase of 1°C. The water temperature in the
experimental chamber was similarly adjusted to reflect the heatwave
conditions, starting from the normal seasonal range (18°C) and gradually
increasing to simulate the rising temperatures experienced during the
heatwave (+0.5°C daily). This setup aimed to replicate the thermal
stress experienced by the seagrass meadow during the actual heatwave
event (Figure~\ref{fig-Profile}).

experiment. The red line indicates air temperature, whereas the blue
line indicates water temperature. Due to the tidal cycle followed during
the experiment, the seagrasses only experience temperatures representade
by solid lines.}

\subsubsection{Measurement and Sampling}\label{measurement-and-sampling}

\paragraph{Radiometric measurement}\label{radiometric-measurement}

Throughout the experiment, hyperspectral signatures of both the control
and treatment seagrasses were taken using an ASD HandHeld 2 equipped
with a fiber optic, allowing measurements to be taken directly inside
the chamber without opening it. An average of five reflectance spectrum
(\(R(\lambda)\)), each with an integration time of 544 ms, was taken
every minute. Every 10 minutes, the fiber optic was switched from one
benthic chamber to the other, in order to measure reflectance in both
treatment and control. Because light conditions were controlled inside
of the chambers, reflectance calibration of the instrument was performed
only each morning at the very first moment of low tide using a
Spectralon white reference with 99\% Lambertian reflectivity.

The second derivative of \(R\) was calculated to retrieve absorption
features and compare their variability over time. Two radiometric
indices were also monitored throughout the experiment :

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI,
  \citep{rouse1974monitoring}), as a proxy of the concentration of
  chlorophyll-a (Equation~\ref{eq-ndvi})
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-ndvi}{
NDVI = \frac{R(840)-R(668)}{R(840)+R(668)}
}\end{equation}

where \(R(840)\) and \(R(668)\) are the reflectance at 840 nm and 668 nm
respectively.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The Green Leaf Index (GLI, \citep{louhaichi2001spatially}), as a
  measurement of the greenness of seagrass leafs (Equation~\ref{eq-gli})
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-gli}{
GLI = \frac{[R(550)-R(668)]+[R(550)-R(450)]}{(2 \times R(550) )+ R(668) + R(450) }
}\end{equation}

where \(R(550)\) and \(R(450)\) are the reflectance in green at 550 nm
and in the blue at 450 nm, respectively.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The Mid-Infrared Water Absorption Index (MIWAI, pers. com.) that is
  design to measure the absorption of the water around 970 nm. The index
  make the difference between a linear interpolation between 950 and 990
  nm and compare that value to the reflectance at 970 nm :
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-MIWAI}{
MIWAI = 0.5 \times [R(990)+R(950)]-R(970)
}\end{equation}

where \(R(990)\), \(R(970)\) and \(R(950)\) are the reflectance in the
infrared at 990, 970 and 950 nm, respectively.
